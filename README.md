In this project I have partially built a HelpDesk-App inspired by : https://dribbble.com/shots/21816219-Ticketing-Capacity-Helpdesk

I have designed a functional backend and interactive interface in which you can : 

1. Create Tickets
2. Update Ticket Status (Todo / In Progress/ Done)
3. Responsive Design

I have tried to make UI similar looking as per requirements.
